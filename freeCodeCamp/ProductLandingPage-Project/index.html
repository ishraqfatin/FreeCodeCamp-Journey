          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Back in the early 60's, Seiko set out to design an affordable
            automatic. So the management and design team probably met up in a
            cigarette smoke-filled conference room with slightly stale snacks in
            one corner and spelled out the 5 pillars they'd create their new
            watch around: an automatic mechanism, decent water resistance, day/
            date complication, crown at 4 o'clock, and a durable case & strap.
            <br />
            <br />
            And the Seiko 5 watch was born!

            The 7S26 automatic winding movement combines simplicity with
            reliability. It's fitted with 21 jewels and beats at 21,600bph. With
            a standard deviation of -20/ +40 seconds a day, the 7S26 isn't the
            most accurate of movements but is pretty reasonable for its' price
            point.
            <br /><br />
            Like all automatics, the SNK809 requires regular wear for it to keep
            going, and has a power reserve of about 40 hours. But even with
            constant wear, you'll have to reset the time every couple of days to
            account for the deviation.

          <p>
            Seiko has used Hardlex, designed in-house, to cover the dial. Apart
            from sounding like a rap rock band from the early 2000's, Hardlex
            offers great scratch resistance and will keep things nice and clear
            much better than regular mineral crystal.
            <br /><br />
            It doesn't come anything close to sapphire in terms of keeping
            scratches at bay, but manages to get the job done quite commendably.

          <h3>Dial</h3>
          <p>
            It has a black dial with white printed Arabic numbers marking the
            hours on the inner circle and minutes on the outer circle.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll find the day/ date complication at 3 o'clock, which can
            either be set in English or Spanish. The dial is pretty much a flat
            affair with the exception of the 5-minute marker bumps on the outer
            circle and the immediately recognizable Seiko 5 logo.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Night time visibility on this Seiko never really gets as much credit
            as it should; it's pretty good!
